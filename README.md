# TK50-Tape-Drive-Leader

Description
===========
Use the CAD files to manufacture a new tape leader for your TK50 tape drive.
Note: NOT compatible with TZ30 (half height) tape drives.
You will need a black PET sheet 0.18mm-0.2mm thick, and some way to cut it. Laser cutting worked for me. See Material.txt for more details.

Testing
=======
Has been tested on a TK50 drive, drive has gone back from unusable (leader torn up) to barely usable (that's the usual state of a TK50 drive).
